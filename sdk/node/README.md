# @gregale/sdk-node

> Node 22 SDK for the Gregale platform. Generated from
> [`api/openapi.yaml`](../../api/openapi.yaml), wrapped in a hand-written
> façade that ships retry, RFC 7807 error sentinels, idempotency, and SSE.

The SDK includes `verifyWebhook` for verifying signed outbound Gregale
webhook requests. See
[`docs/webhook-receiver-verification.md`](../../docs/webhook-receiver-verification.md)
for usage and delivery-ID deduplication guidance.

> **Heads-up: publish state.** The manifest name is now the conventional
> scoped form `@gregale/sdk-node`. It was previously `gregale` + `/skd-node`
> — a typo that npm rejects outright, since an unscoped name may not contain
> a slash. `private` is cleared and the `repository` field is set. `publishConfig.access` stays `restricted` until the licensing
> question in [`sdk/README-publishing.md`](../README-publishing.md) is
> settled — the current LICENSE is proprietary and non-redistributable.
> **Nothing is on the public npm registry yet.**
>
> **Heads-up: pre-1.0.** Version `0.1.0` is the pre-1.0 signal. The
> public API may shift between `0.x` releases. Pin to an exact version
> in your `package.json` until `1.0.0` ships.

## Requirements

- Node ≥ 22.10 for the Node SDK entry point (uses
  `--experimental-strip-types` at dev-time and global `fetch` at runtime).
- The browser subpath uses the standard Fetch API and has no Node-only runtime
  imports.
- npm ≥ 10 (or `pnpm`/`yarn` compatible).

## Install

Once the package is published:

```sh
npm install @gregale/sdk-node
```

**Today it is not published yet**, so install from a locally built tarball.
npm cannot install a package from a subdirectory of a git repo, so
`npm install github:poyrazK/faas#<tag>` does *not* work — the repo root has
no `package.json`, and `dist/` is a build artifact that is not committed.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/poyrazK/faas.git
cd faas/sdk/node
npm ci && npm run build
npm pack --pack-destination /tmp     # -> /tmp/gregale-sdk-node-0.1.0.tgz

cd /path/to/your/project
npm install /tmp/gregale-sdk-node-0.1.0.tgz
```

## Container listeners

UDP ingress requires an operator-enabled public edge and source-CIDR/firewall
rollout. The app must declare the guest UDP port. Reserving a listener creates a
disabled endpoint; enable it explicitly after deployment and rollout checks:

```ts
import { FaaSClient, AppsService } from '@gregale/sdk-node';

new FaaSClient('https://api.example.com', { token: process.env.FAAS_TOKEN! });
const udp = await AppsService.createAppUdpListener({
  slug: 'app', requestBody: { name: 'dns', guest_port: 5353 },
});
await AppsService.updateAppUdpListener({
  slug: 'app', name: udp.name, requestBody: { enabled: true },
});
```

An existing TCP listener can terminate TLS using a verified app-owned hostname.
The operator provisions its certificate bundle on the serving edge. Updating TLS
policy disables the listener; send a separate enable mutation after provisioning:

```ts
await AppsService.updateAppTcpListener({
  slug: 'app', name: 'echo',
  requestBody: { tls: { mode: 'terminate', hostname: 'echo.example.com' } },
});
await AppsService.updateAppTcpListener({
  slug: 'app', name: 'echo', requestBody: { enabled: true },
});
const status = await AppsService.appTcpListenerTlsStatus({ slug: 'app', name: 'echo' });
console.log(status.observations);
```

Supply exactly one of `enabled` or `tls` in each TCP update. Status covers observed
edges only: empty observations or `unknown` do not establish readiness. Certificate
readiness does not prove fleet coverage, client trust or guest availability.
Native listener qualification remains pending; see the
[qualification procedure](../../docs/container-qualification.md).

## Quick start

```ts
import { FaaSClient, AppsService, ErrNotFound } from '@gregale/sdk-node';

const client = new FaaSClient('https://api.example.com', {
  token: process.env.FAAS_TOKEN!,
  retry: { maxAttempts: 3, backoffMs: 100 },
});

try {
  const app = await AppsService.getApp({ slug: 'hello' });
  console.log(app.url);
} catch (err) {
  if (err instanceof ErrNotFound) {
    console.warn('app does not exist');
  } else {
    throw err;
  }
}
```

The four canonical error sentinels (`ErrNotFound`, `ErrUnauthorized`,
`ErrRateLimited`, `ErrCapacity`) all extend `FaasError` and carry the
parsed RFC 7807 `Problem` envelope, the HTTP status, and the daemon's
`tx_id` for support tickets.

## Supported surface

### Resumable managed realtime preview

`consumeRealtimeChannel` processes one v2 channel and reconnects with the last
saved cursor. Supply a durable cursor store and a WebSocket factory that adds
the endpoint's OIDC bearer token. For example, with the separate `ws` package
(`npm install ws` and `npm install -D @types/ws` for TypeScript):

```ts
import WebSocket from 'ws';
import { consumeRealtimeChannel } from '@gregale/sdk-node';

await consumeRealtimeChannel({
  url: 'wss://app.example.com/__gregale/realtime/ENDPOINT_ID',
  channel: 'notifications',
  cursorStore: {
    load: async () => Number(await cursorDB.get('notifications') ?? 0),
    save: async (sequence) => { await cursorDB.set('notifications', sequence); },
  },
  onMessage: async ({ sequence, data }) => {
    await processNotification(sequence, data); // make this idempotent by sequence
  },
  onResync: async (gap) => {
    const snapshot = await rebuildNotificationState({
      channel: gap.channel,
      throughSequence: gap.latestSequence,
    });
    await replaceNotificationState(snapshot.state);
    return snapshot.sequence; // fully represented by the rebuilt state
  },
  webSocketFactory: async (url, protocols) => new WebSocket(url, protocols, {
    headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${await getFreshOidcToken()}` },
  }),
});
```

The helper calls `onMessage`, saves its cursor, then sends the ack. If
processing or saving fails it stops without advancing. A crash between the
application side effect and cursor save can cause redelivery, so deduplicate
using the channel and sequence. When possible, store that deduplication key
with the application side effect in one transaction.
An expired cursor calls `onResync` with the channel, stale cursor, and retained
history bounds. Return a cursor between `oldestSequence - 1` and
`latestSequence` that the rebuilt state fully represents; the helper saves it
before reconnecting. Omit `onResync` to receive `RealtimeResyncRequiredError`
and perform recovery outside the consumer. Cancel with an `AbortSignal` to
stop reconnecting. This preview requires both server preview flags and the
endpoint's channel authorization callback described in
[managed realtime operations](../../docs/ops/realtime.md).

Use `consumeRealtimeChannels` to multiplex up to eight channels on one
WebSocket. Each channel has its own cursor store, message handler, and optional
resync callback; the connection URL, token factory, retry policy, and abort
signal are shared:

```ts
import WebSocket from 'ws';
import { consumeRealtimeChannels } from '@gregale/sdk-node';

await consumeRealtimeChannels({
  url: 'wss://app.example.com/__gregale/realtime/ENDPOINT_ID',
  channels: [
    {
      channel: 'jobs',
      cursorStore: jobCursorStore,
      onMessage: async (message) => updateJobProgress(message),
    },
    {
      channel: 'notifications',
      cursorStore: notificationCursorStore,
      onMessage: async (message) => processNotification(message),
    },
  ],
  webSocketFactory: async (url, protocols) => new WebSocket(url, protocols, {
    headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${await getFreshOidcToken()}` },
  }),
});
```

Handlers run sequentially in received frame order, so slow processing applies
backpressure to every channel on that socket. A resync on one channel saves
that channel's rebuilt cursor and reconnects the shared socket; the other
channels resume from their own saved cursors and can receive duplicates under
the at-least-once delivery model. `consumeRealtimeChannel` remains available
for a single channel and uses the same implementation.

Backend publishers can pass a stable key to the generated API service. Derive
it once from the logical event or outbox row, and reuse it only when retrying
that exact payload:

```ts
import { RealtimeService } from '@gregale/sdk-node';

const payload = Buffer.from(JSON.stringify(event));
const outcome = await RealtimeService.publishManagedRealtimeChannel({
  slug: 'my-app',
  id: 'ENDPOINT_ID',
  channel: 'jobs',
  idempotencyKey: `job-event:${event.id}`,
  requestBody: { data_base64: payload.toString('base64') },
});
```

The server replays the original outcome for 24 hours. A replay of a partial
publish does not retry subscribers that missed it; use a new key for a new
attempt only when possible duplicates are acceptable. A key reused with a
different payload or delivery mode returns `409`.

To make a message resumable, opt into retained delivery. It requires the apid
retained-history preview flag, the realtimed resume preview flag, a stable key,
and a payload no larger than 4 KiB. The response includes the durable channel
sequence; v2 subscribers read messages in that order, while raw-frame clients
receive the normal live publish:

```ts
const retained = await RealtimeService.publishManagedRealtimeChannel({
  slug: 'my-app',
  id: 'ENDPOINT_ID',
  channel: 'jobs',
  delivery: 'retained',
  idempotencyKey: `job-event:${event.id}:retained`,
  requestBody: { data_base64: payload.toString('base64') },
});
console.log(retained.sequence, retained.durable);
```

Browser clients import from the browser subpath. The server accepts a bounded
OIDC JWT in a reserved WebSocket subprotocol when the endpoint has an explicit
`allowed_origins` entry matching the page's origin:

```ts
import {
  consumeRealtimeChannel,
  createBrowserRealtimeSocketFactory,
} from '@gregale/sdk-node/browser';

const cursorKey = `realtime:ENDPOINT_ID:${currentUser.id}:notifications`;
await consumeRealtimeChannel({
  url: 'wss://app.example.com/__gregale/realtime/ENDPOINT_ID',
  channel: 'notifications',
  cursorStore: {
    load: () => Number(localStorage.getItem(cursorKey) ?? 0),
    save: (sequence) => { localStorage.setItem(cursorKey, String(sequence)); },
  },
  onMessage: async ({ sequence, data }) => {
    await processNotification(sequence, data); // deduplicate by channel and sequence
  },
  webSocketFactory: createBrowserRealtimeSocketFactory(getFreshOidcToken),
});
```

The factory fetches a fresh JWT on every reconnect. For project release
pinning, pass `createGregaleBrowserFetch(...).webSocket` as its second argument.
The browser cursor is scoped to the current user; if browser storage is cleared
or evicted, the application may need to rebuild state and save a fresh cursor.
The JWT travels in the `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` request header during the
handshake. Keep it short lived and redact that header from proxy access logs.
The server verifies the JWT, requires an exact allowed origin, removes the
credential before application authorization hooks run, and selects only
`gregale.realtime.v2` as the response subprotocol.

Server-side Node services can also use the hand-written
`createServiceCallerVerifier` helper to verify Gregale's incoming internal
service-call assertions. It uses the platform public JWKS endpoint and Node's
built-in Ed25519 support. See [the networking guide](../../docs/networking.md#verifying-the-caller-preview)
for setup, rollout requirements, and an HTTP handler example. Verification
authenticates the caller but does not replace the target's caller allowlist or
business authorization.

Every operation in `api/openapi.yaml` is reachable through the
generated services. The canonical mapping:

| OpenAPI tag | Generated service |
|---|---|
| `account` | `AccountService` |
| `apps` | `AppsService` |
| `audit` | `AuditService` |
| `auth` | `AuthService` |
| `crons` | `CronsService` |
| `delayed_tasks` | `DelayedTasksService` |
| `deployments` | `DeploymentsService` |
| `domains` | `DomainsService` |
| `github` | `GithubService` |
| `instances` | `InstancesService` |
| `invocations` | `InvocationsService` |
| `keys` | `KeysService` |
| `meta` | `MetaService` |
| `mfa` | `MfaService` |
| `queues` | `QueuesService` |
| `runs` | `RunsService` |
| `secrets` | `SecretsService` |
| `usage` | `UsageService` |

Regenerate via `npm run gen` (committed per ADR-013; CI's
`sdk-gen-node` job is the dirty-diff gate).

## Transactional operation handlers

For managed HTTP operations, `operationRequestFromHeaders` verifies negotiated
support and captures the trusted identity with original request bytes.
`withOperationTransaction(pool, operation, callback)` commits the callback's
PostgreSQL writes and managed result/webhook intent together. A later attempt
returns the saved response without repeating committed writes.

Install `operationReceiptSchema` explicitly as the database owner. Use an idle,
exclusively leased pg-compatible pool connection. Send `response.body` unchanged
as `application/json`; `response.replayed` identifies receipt recovery. See the
[transactional handler guide](../../docs/operation-transactions.md) for Express,
receipt retention, and uncertain commit handling.

## Idempotency contract

Every mutating call (POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE) carries an `Idempotency-Key`
header. The semantic contract is identical to the Go SDK:

- **Auto-mint (default).** The wrapper mints a fresh UUIDv4 on **every
  attempt**, not per-call. This means each retry sees a fresh key and
  the server's 24h replay window sees a fresh retry budget per attempt;
  a retried `CreateApp` is a new logical request from the server's
  perspective, never a double-bill.
- **Opt-in stable key.** For deployments that need to survive across
  processes (CI deploys, retry-batched jobs), pin a stable key so the
  server replays the original response on retry rather than minting
  new logic:

  ```ts
  client.setIdempotencyKey('deploy-2026-07-26-batch-7');
  await AppsService.createApp({ requestBody: { slug: 'foo' } });
  // Subsequent retries of the same logical operation will receive
  // the same response from the server's 24h replay window.
  ```

  The key is process-wide on the `FaaSClient` instance and persists
  until reset. Pass a fresh key per logically independent call.

GET/HEAD skip the header — the server doesn't dedupe reads.

The `client.setIdempotencyKey` API is the only public stable-key wire-in
in PR 5. A future AsyncLocalStorage-based per-call key (PR 11 if
docs customers request it) would layer on top without breaking the
existing contract.

## Login-target observation

For a `POST` login route configured with `failed_responses`, central
coordination, and `observe_targets: true`, attach an opaque target to each
selected failed response. Use the exact normalization applied during account
lookup for both existing and unknown accounts:

```ts
import { PRE_AUTH_TARGET_HEADER, preAuthTargetDigest } from '@gregale/sdk-node';

const targetKey = process.env.GREGALE_ABUSE_TARGET_KEY;
if (!targetKey) throw new Error('GREGALE_ABUSE_TARGET_KEY is required');

function failedLoginResponse(normalizedIdentifier: string): Response {
  return new Response('Invalid credentials', {
    status: 401,
    headers: { [PRE_AUTH_TARGET_HEADER]: preAuthTargetDigest(targetKey, normalizedIdentifier) },
  });
}
```

Create a random key of at least 32 bytes, keep it server-side, and share it
across replicas. The helper takes an already-normalized identifier and returns
a lowercase HMAC-SHA256 digest. It does not decide which responses are login
failures. Attach the header exactly once only on failed responses. Gregale
removes it before returning the response to the client. See
[pre-auth security guidance](../../docs/security.md) for tenant-scoped
identifiers and key rotation. Call `failedLoginResponse` with the normalized
lookup value after either an unknown account or an incorrect credential.

## Dev Bridge request context

Opt a remote HTTP service into preserving a developer's routing context across
managed service calls. In an Express service, install `devBridgeMiddleware` before
handlers and use `createDevBridgeFetch` for outbound HTTP:

```ts
import { devBridgeMiddleware, createDevBridgeFetch } from '@gregale/sdk-node';

app.use(devBridgeMiddleware);
const serviceFetch = createDevBridgeFetch();
const paymentsURL = process.env.GREGALE_SERVICE_PAYMENTS_URL;
if (!paymentsURL) throw new Error('Declare the payments service binding');
app.get('/charge', async (_request, response) => {
  const result = await serviceFetch(paymentsURL + '/charge');
  response.status(result.status).send(await result.text());
});
```

For a framework using Fetch headers, wrap its handler with
`withDevBridgeRequestContext(request.headers, handler)`. AsyncLocalStorage keeps
concurrent developer and ordinary requests separate. The wrapper removes explicit
bridge credentials on every destination and propagates request context only to
single-label `NAME.svc.gregale` or `NAME.internal` discovery names. Gregale still
authorizes the lease at each hop. Application `Authorization` is preserved.

Scoped managed requests use manual redirects: inspect `Location` and call the
wrapper again if the application chooses to follow it. Do not hand the scoped
request to an unwrapped fetch that automatically follows redirects. The helpers
are Node-only; the browser subpath does not expose laptop/session authority.
See [the Dev Bridge guide](../../docs/dev-bridge.md) for local execution.

## Project release context

Capture the release selected for an inbound Gregale request and use the
wrapped fetch for outbound managed service calls. The helper forwards only
`X-Gregale-Release` to `*.svc.gregale` and removes the caller-scoped
`X-Gregale-Revision` header on that hop:

```ts
import { createGregaleFetch, withGregaleRequestContext } from '@gregale/sdk-node';

const serviceFetch = createGregaleFetch();

async function checkout(request: Request) {
  return withGregaleRequestContext(request.headers, async () => {
    return serviceFetch('http://billing.svc.gregale:10080/checkout', { method: 'POST' });
  });
}
```

The async context is isolated between concurrent handlers. Use it only around
work caused by that inbound request; detached background jobs should capture
the release explicitly when they are enqueued.

### Browser SPA release pinning

For an SSR-rendered document, put the release selected on the inbound page
request into the HTML before sending it. Gregale has already resolved the
active release and forwarded it to the app as `X-Gregale-Release`:

```ts
import { gregaleReleaseMetaTag } from '@gregale/sdk-node';

function renderPage(request: Request): Response {
  const releaseMeta = gregaleReleaseMetaTag(request.headers);
  const html = `<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>${releaseMeta}</head>
  <body><div id="app"></div><script type="module" src="/app.js"></script></body>
</html>`;
  return new Response(html, { headers: { 'Content-Type': 'text/html; charset=utf-8' } });
}
```

The helper emits nothing when the request has no valid release ID, and only
emits the UUID form accepted by the gateway's release-pin API. Since this
value is request-specific, shared caches for rendered HTML must be disabled or
keyed by `X-Gregale-Release`.

Browser clients can use the browser-safe fetch adapter without importing the
Node-only SDK entry point:

```ts
import { createGregaleBrowserFetch } from '@gregale/sdk-node/browser';

const releaseFromBootstrap = document
  .querySelector('meta[name="gregale-release"]')
  ?.getAttribute('content') ?? undefined;
const gregale = createGregaleBrowserFetch({
  managedOrigins: ['https://api.example.com'],
  // Prefer the release that served this app when it is available.
  initialRelease: releaseFromBootstrap,
});

const response = await gregale.fetch('https://api.example.com/v1/checkout', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ cartId: 'cart-123' }),
});
```

The adapter adds `X-Gregale-Release` only to configured Gregale origins,
captures it from the first eligible response when no initial release was
provided, and pins later calls from that adapter instance. It serializes
concurrent unpinned startup calls while discovering the release. The
discovery request itself follows the active release, so inject `initialRelease`
from the HTML/SSR/bootstrap response when the API must match the exact release
that served the client. For static SPAs, Gregale sets the host-only,
JavaScript-readable `__Host-gregale_release` cookie on a document navigation
when a release graph is selected. The browser adapter reads that cookie when
created and uses it as the initial release, including for configured
cross-origin API origins. The cookie is a routing identifier, not a secret;
Gregale removes it before forwarding requests to the guest. Apps must have
revision pin retention enabled, and any cache in front of the app must preserve
the document response's `Set-Cookie` header with its body. It is a browser
session cookie; the release graph's server-side TTL controls whether its value
is still routable.

Same-host browser WebSocket reconnects use the same bootstrap cookie without a
custom header: the native `WebSocket` API does not expose request headers. The
gateway reads the cookie only on a WebSocket handshake, routes to that release
if it remains eligible, and strips the platform cookie before the guest sees
the request. Because `__Host-` cookies are host-only, this automatic browser
behavior applies when the SPA and WebSocket endpoint share a hostname.

For a WebSocket endpoint on a separate managed API hostname, use the adapter's
`webSocket` helper after seeding or discovering the release:

```ts
const socket = gregale.webSocket('wss://api.example.com/events', ['graphql-transport-ws']);
```

The helper appends a reserved `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` token carrying the
release UUID. Gregale consumes it before the application handshake, preserves
your application protocols, and removes any guest attempt to negotiate the
reserved token back to the browser. The token is a routing identifier, not a
secret; it is not placed in the URL. The endpoint origin must be listed in
`managedOrigins`. If the adapter has no release yet, `webSocket` throws rather
than opening an unpinned socket; seed `initialRelease` from SSR/bootstrap or
make a managed fetch first. Ordinary browser `new WebSocket(...)` calls do not
automatically pin cross-host endpoints.

State is in-memory per adapter instance after initialization; create a new
instance for a new client session. A 410 expired-release response is returned
unchanged and is never retried against the active release. Call `clearRelease()`
only when the application intentionally wants to start a new release context;
it also clears the bootstrap cookie for the current host.

For cross-origin APIs, configure CORS to expose `X-Gregale-Release` and allow
it as a request header. The default CORS policy already exposes both release
and revision response headers.

This SSR bootstrap binds the browser to the release that served its document.
A static HTML file served without request-time rendering cannot read the
navigation response headers from JavaScript; it must provide a release-specific
bootstrap value during publishing, or use a dynamic document/bootstrap route.
Without a seeded value, the adapter can only learn the active release from its
first API response and pin subsequent calls.

## Execution streaming

Disposable executions expose a typed, resumable iterator. It consumes output
as it is emitted and reconnects with the latest event cursor if the SSE
connection drops:

```ts
for await (const event of client.watchExecution(execution.id)) {
  if (event.type === 'stdout' || event.type === 'stderr') {
    process.stdout.write(event.data.chunk ?? '');
  }
  if (event.type === 'terminal') console.log(event.data.status);
}
```

`RunsService.streamExecutionEvents()` remains available when a raw SSE body
is needed. `watchExecution` is the recommended agent-runtime path.

For the common submit-and-wait flow, `runExecution` composes create, resumable
watching, and the terminal receipt:

```ts
const receipt = await client.runExecution(
  { runtime: 'node22', source: "console.log('hello')" },
  {
    onEvent: (event) => {
      if (event.type === 'stdout') process.stdout.write(event.data.chunk ?? '');
    },
  },
);
```

The source/files bundle is available only in the disposable guest's ephemeral
scratch filesystem; no customer storage disk is attached.

## SSE streaming

`/v1/logs/{app_id}/tail` (and a few other out-of-spec streams) expose
`text/event-stream`. Use `streamSse` for those raw streams:

```ts
import { streamSse } from '@gregale/sdk-node';

const resp = await fetch(`${client.baseURL}/v1/logs/hello/tail`, {
  headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.FAAS_TOKEN}` },
});
for await (const ev of streamSse(resp, signal)) {
  console.log(ev.event, ev.data);
}
```

The parser handles the canonical SSE wire shape (LF or CRLF, comment
lines starting with `:`, multi-line `data:` joined with `\n`, unknown
fields ignored, `id:` + `retry:` surfaced). See
[`test/sse.test.ts`](./test/sse.test.ts) for the parsing contract.

`streamSse` honours the caller's `AbortSignal` for read cancellation
but does **not** layer a timeout — the caller owns the deadline. Pass
`AbortSignal.timeout(ms)` if you need a hard cap.

## Co-tenant code: the global fetch wrapper

The `FaaSClient` constructor replaces `globalThis.fetch` with the
wrapper chain (retry → RFC 7807 unwrap → logger → idempotency →
user fetch). This is the only injection point the
`openapi-typescript-codegen@0.31.0` generator exposes — see
`src/generated/core/request.ts:219`. **All other `fetch` calls in your
process see the wrapper too.**

Implications for callers:

- The wrapper is installed for the entire Node process, not just for
  requests routed through the SDK services. `fetch('https://other.example/')`
  in your code will also pass through the retry + idempotency stack.
- The `rfc7807Layer` raises typed `FaasError` sentinels on
  Problem-shaped bodies. If your own code calls `fetch` and inspects
  4xx/5xx responses, a 404 from your own endpoint will now throw
  `ErrNotFound` instead of returning a `Response` object. Two ways
  to mitigate:
  1. Pass a dedicated `fetch` via `FaaSClientOptions.fetch` — this
     bypasses the global entirely.
  2. Construct the `FaaSClient` only when you actually need it (e.g.
     inside a request handler), and call `uninstall()` on teardown.
- Two `FaaSClient` instances in the same process will clobber each
  other's wrapper. The library is designed for one `FaaSClient` per
  process (typical usage: module-level singleton).

Test rigs that mock `fetch` should pass `fetch: mockFn` via
`FaaSClientOptions` rather than setting `globalThis.fetch` directly —
the wrapper will chain the mock in the correct order.

## Zero runtime dependencies

`dependencies: {}` — the wrapper uses only Web APIs (`fetch`,
`AbortController`, `Headers`, `URL`) plus Node 22 built-ins
(`node:crypto`, `node:test`, `node:child_process`, `node:net`).

The `devDependencies` pin `openapi-typescript-codegen@0.31.0` and
`typescript@5.6.3`. Major-version bumps require an ADR.

## CI

The `sdk-gen-node` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs
`npm ci && npm run gen:check` (regen + dirty-diff assert). The
`sdk-smoke-node` job builds the fakeapid fixture, runs `npm run
test:smoke`, and tears down. The `sdk-unit-node` job runs the
in-process unit tests (`sse.test.ts`, `post-process.test.mjs`) which
don't require the fixture.

## License

Internal — see `LICENSE`.
## Internal HTTP Operations preview

Operations is staged and production submission remains disabled. For locally
enabled acceptance, import `GregaleOperationClient` from the browser entry point
and supply a callback that obtains a current tenant-bound token:

```ts
import { GregaleOperationClient } from '@gregale/sdk-node/browser';

const operations = new GregaleOperationClient({
  apiURL: 'https://api.example.com',
  credential: () => session.currentTenantToken(),
});
const receipt = await operations.start(definitionID, { count: 100 }, submissionKey);
for await (const update of operations.subscribe(receipt.id, { signal })) {
  await saveAndRender(update);
}
```

Keep `submissionKey` stable for duplicate submissions. Account API keys stay on
the backend. The client refreshes credentials on reconnect; persist the applied
event cursor and pass it as `after` when rebuilding the client.

Server handlers import `GregaleOperations` from the main entry point and wrap
trusted Gregale guest requests with `runRequest(req.headers, handler)`. Within
that handler, use `progress({ report_id, stage, completed, total })` and
`artifact({ report_id, name, uri, size_bytes, sha256 })`. Use stable report IDs
when repeating a report. Workload metadata is fetched for every report, while
the current invocation capability stays private to its request context.
See [Operations](../../docs/operations.md) for ownership, retention and recovery.

For an immutable definition with `http_transaction_version: 1`, explicitly
install `customerOperationReceiptSchema` in the application PostgreSQL database.
Call `operations.transaction({ headers, method, path, body }, pool, async tx => result)`
after business authorization, using the original request target and body bytes.
Send the returned `body` as JSON without re-encoding it. The business writes and
result receipt commit together; later authorized executions return the saved
bytes with `replayed: true` and skip the callback. The callback must use only the
supplied transaction and must not commit, roll back, or perform external effects.
Unknown COMMIT is surfaced as `OperationCommitUnknownError`; keep the original
Operation identity for recovery. This customer protocol returns the complete
business result and uses a separate receipt table from managed operations.
The [handler integration](../../docs/operations.md#postgresql-http-handler-transactions)
includes an example and retention requirements. The runnable
[order-fulfillment example](../../examples/customer-operation-orders/README.md)
adds source declarations, deployment packaging, explicit database setup, and
progress after commit. Definition discovery exposes the pinned transaction version.

Completion delivery inspection, attempt history, and immutable retry decisions
are exposed through the Operations APIs (`getOperationDelivery`,
`getOperationDeliveryAttempts`, `retryOperationDeliveryWithReceipt`; PascalCase
in Go and snake_case Python modules). New retries carry `retry_id`, `delivery_id`
and an explicit `expected_replay_generation`, including zero. Reuse the same
request after an uncertain reply; the returned `queued` receipt describes the
original decision. Read delivery status separately. Business results and
execution generations are unaffected. The legacy retry method remains available.


## Object version protection

The Storage API supports typed retention/legal-hold reads and mutations, plus
protection operation inspection. Use an explicit owned public version UUIDv4
(or `null` in an eligible Object Lock bucket). Mutations require a stable UUIDv4
operation ID and return a durable receipt; retain the returned ID for retries
and status. Fixed GOVERNANCE/COMPLIANCE retention and independent ON/OFF legal
holds are supported. Event-hold changes and governance bypass are unsupported.
See [the protection contract](../../docs/object-storage.md#per-version-retention-and-legal-holds)
for enrollment, pending-operation fences and recovery behavior.

Customer HTTP transactions can declare business milestone schemas in their source manifest. Install the current `customerOperationReceiptSchema`, then call `tx.milestone('order-fulfilled', {order_id, status: 'fulfilled'})` inside `GregaleOperations.transaction`. The SDK validates before commit and saves a durable outbox with the business write and result receipt. It publishes after commit; `OperationMilestonePublicationError.committed` identifies a pending publication that recovery of the same Operation can replay without repeating business work.

To report the current state of a workflow instance, declare its accepted values under `operation_workflows[].states` and call `tx.workflowState('order-lifecycle', workflowRunID, 'completed')` in that same transaction. Optionally list terminal values under `operation_workflows[].terminal_states`; each must be a declared state and cannot have an outgoing transition. The workflow read API returns `terminal: true` for a reported state in that list and `false` otherwise. If the workflow declares `transitions`, call `tx.workflowTransition('order-lifecycle', workflowRunID, 'fulfillment-in-progress', 'completed')`; check the source value against the locked business row first. The SDK validates that the edge is declared and, when a prior state report exists, checks that `from_state` matches it before commit. A mismatch aborts the business transaction. The first report can establish history, so the application still checks the business row. The SDK allocates an increasing revision per workflow instance and stores the report in the app-side outbox. It publishes after commit, and recovery retries pending reports. A committed publication failure is reported as `OperationWorkflowStatePublicationError` with `committed = true`. Business-reference reads expose the newest revision and update time; a delayed older report cannot replace it. States are explicit application reports.

Customer clients read `client.milestones(operationID, {limit, cursor})` and `client.businessMilestones({appID, scope, subjectType: 'order', subjectID: orderID})`. Add `workflow` and `workflowInstanceID` together to select one workflow run. That response includes its retained `workflow_state_history`; continue it with `workflowStateCursor`, separate from the milestone `cursor`. Business references preserve the existing customer boundary, and each cursor is bound to all filters. Milestone payloads must contain only schema-declared public JSON facts. See [the Operations guide](../../docs/operations.md) for limits and recovery semantics.

Business-reference responses also include current workflow states where the application has reported one. Each entry has a workflow name, instance ID, state, terminal and stale classifications, the app-reported occurrence time, revision, and publication update time. Set `staleOnly: true` on `businessMilestones` to filter its current-state entries to runs beyond their app-declared `state_stale_after` threshold; milestone facts and state history remain unchanged.

## Batch event publication

`EventsService.publishEventBatch({ requestBody: { events } })` accepts 1–100
stable-id envelopes in at most 1 MiB. Inspect every `results` entry: HTTP 200
can include rejected or unknown items. Retry with the original source/id/content;
duplicates retain their original receipt and do not create more deliveries.
See [batch publication](../../docs/event-driven.md#batch-event-publishing).

## Event retention health

The generated events service exposes `getEventRetentionHealth` (Node) or
`faas_sdk.api.events.get_event_retention_health` (Python). Filter receipt
observations by source/app and choose an expiry lookahead; storage utilization
remains account-wide. Recovery preflight also returns current receipt expiry
warnings and current retention holds. See [retention health](../../docs/event-driven.md#retention-health-and-expiry-alerts).

## Recovery receipt protection

Set `protect_receipts: true` when creating an event recovery job (Go:
`EventRecoveryRequest.ProtectReceipts`). Selected receipts remain held while
items are pending and the job is active, until its original 24-hour expiry.
Preview reserves nothing. Held receipts continue counting against account
storage limits. See [recovery protection](../../docs/event-driven.md#protect-receipts-during-bulk-recovery).

## Durable recovery outcomes

Existing recovery status and item reads prefer saved terminal results for the
exact admitted replay generation. `execution.source` is `recovery_result`, with
`recorded_at` and original `evidence_source`; job execution summaries include
`saved_results`. These results survive execution-history pruning until the
recovery job is pruned. Uncertain outcomes remain unknown. See
[terminal recovery results](../../docs/event-driven.md#durable-terminal-recovery-results).

Recovery webhook filters support `event_recovery.execution_finished`, separately
from admission completion. Its `EventRecoveryExecutionFinishedWebhookPayload`
contains saved terminal execution counts and `unresolved_count=0`; `all_succeeded`
refers only to queued executions. Recovery job `execution_finished_at` is capture
time, not webhook acknowledgement. Unknown evidence blocks capture. Only newly
created execution jobs with queued deliveries qualify. Update strict webhook
event-enum consumers before API rollout; existing webhook delivery retries and
dead-letter tools apply. See [ADR-833](../../docs/adr/833-recovery-execution-completion-notifications.md).

Existing recovery preview/create methods accept `parent_job_id` with
`mode=execution` to select only saved failed/dead-lettered deliveries from a
retained terminal recovery in the same app. Child creation requires a stable
`request_id` UUID: repeat it with the same normalized selection to return the same
retained child. Changed selections conflict, and the original audit reason wins.
Items expose historical `parent_job_id`/`parent_position` links. Changed or pruned
execution evidence is skipped at admission; newer replays are never substituted.
See [parent-scoped retries](../../docs/event-driven.md#retry-failures-from-one-recovery-job).

`EventsService.getEventRecoveryHealth` includes optional execution health for the
oldest retained unresolved terminal-admission jobs. `counts_complete=false`
marks lower-bound counts; prolonged waits measure time since admission completion.
See [execution recovery health](../../docs/adr/835-execution-recovery-health-alerts.md).

Use `EventsService.getEventRecoveryNotifications(jobID)` for a read-only report
of admission/execution capture and each selected receiver's current delivery.
Missing selection or pruned delivery evidence remains unknown; capture alone
does not prove acknowledgement. Retained dead deliveries link to independent
retry. See [notification delivery reports](../../docs/adr/836-recovery-notification-delivery-report.md).

### Recovery notification health

Recovery health responses include `notifications`, with separate admission and execution
counts for overdue, dead, unknown, and no-receiver jobs. Overdue requires known
unacknowledged delivery evidence at least 15 minutes after capture. Phase
`counts_complete` flags cover evidence uncertainty and the 50-job candidate bound;
partial observations cannot clear alerts. Use the notification report for receiver
details. New alert metrics are optional and require the notification health migration.

### Selective recovery notification retries

Use the job-scoped notification retry preview to choose receivers explicitly.
Submit a stable UUID request ID and targets containing kind, webhook ID, delivery
ID, and expected replay generation. The API revalidates each receiver and saves
queued or skipped decisions atomically. Repeating identical intent returns the
original decisions; use a new ID and current evidence for later failures.
Decisions expire with the recovery job. See the events documentation for limits
and migration rollout.

### Recovery notification retry history

Use the retry history methods to list saved request summaries or inspect one
request by ID. Detail preserves each receiver’s original queued or skipped
decision and shows its current retained delivery status with a separate read
timestamp. Missing deliveries are reported as unavailable; job pruning removes
the history.

Retry history detail also exposes `retry_outcome` for the original queued
generation, `retained_attempt_count`, `attempt_count_complete`, and optional
`completed_at`. Later retries do not establish an earlier generation's outcome.
Missing terminal evidence reports unknown; skipped decisions are not applicable.

History list summaries now include succeeded, failed, pending, and unknown
counts for the originally queued generations, aggregate `status`,
`evidence_complete`, and optional `completed_at`. Completion time requires
terminal evidence for every queued target. All-skipped requests are inconclusive;
later retries never establish an earlier generation's outcome.

Retry history lists accept an optional comma-separated `status` union such as
`failed,inconclusive`. Statuses must be distinct values from succeeded, failed,
pending, and inconclusive. The response includes `matched_count` and `totals`;
totals count all retained requests before filtering, including a separate count
of requests with incomplete evidence. No matches returns an empty list and
preserves full totals. Request detail and waiting do not accept this filter.

### App-wide recovery notification retry backlog

Use the notification retry backlog list method to discover original-generation
retry outcomes across retained recovery jobs for an app. Default statuses are
failed, pending, and inconclusive; an explicit status union can include succeeded.
`page_size` counts inspected jobs (default 5, maximum 10), not request rows.
Totals have `counts_scope: job_page` and cover scanned jobs before filtering.
Continue with `next_cursor` even when `requests` is empty, retaining the same
status selection. Each page is a fresh read-only snapshot. Returned detail and
retry-preview paths use existing recovery inspection endpoints.
