# @gregale/sdk-node

> Node 22 SDK for the Gregale platform. Generated from
> [`api/openapi.yaml`](../../api/openapi.yaml), wrapped in a hand-written
> façade that ships retry, RFC 7807 error sentinels, idempotency, and SSE.

> **Heads-up: publish state.** The manifest name is now the conventional
> scoped form `@gregale/sdk-node`. It was previously `gregale` + `/skd-node`
> — a typo that npm rejects outright, since an unscoped name may not contain
> a slash. `private` is cleared and the `repository` field is set. `publishConfig.access` stays `restricted` until the licensing
> question in [`sdk/README-publishing.md`](../README-publishing.md) is
> settled — the current LICENSE is proprietary and non-redistributable.
> **Nothing is on the public npm registry yet.**
>
> **Heads-up: pre-1.0.** Version `0.1.0` is the pre-1.0 signal. The
> public API may shift between `0.x` releases. Pin to an exact version
> in your `package.json` until `1.0.0` ships.

## Requirements

- Node ≥ 22.10 (uses `--experimental-strip-types` at dev-time and the
  stable global `fetch` at runtime).
- npm ≥ 10 (or `pnpm`/`yarn` compatible).

## Install

Once the package is published:

```sh
npm install @gregale/sdk-node
```

**Today it is not published yet**, so install from a locally built tarball.
npm cannot install a package from a subdirectory of a git repo, so
`npm install github:poyrazK/faas#<tag>` does *not* work — the repo root has
no `package.json`, and `dist/` is a build artifact that is not committed.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/poyrazK/faas.git
cd faas/sdk/node
npm ci && npm run build
npm pack --pack-destination /tmp     # -> /tmp/gregale-sdk-node-0.1.0.tgz

cd /path/to/your/project
npm install /tmp/gregale-sdk-node-0.1.0.tgz
```

## Quick start

```ts
import { FaaSClient, AppsService, ErrNotFound } from '@gregale/sdk-node';

const client = new FaaSClient('https://api.example.com', {
  token: process.env.FAAS_TOKEN!,
  retry: { maxAttempts: 3, backoffMs: 100 },
});

try {
  const app = await AppsService.getApp({ slug: 'hello' });
  console.log(app.url);
} catch (err) {
  if (err instanceof ErrNotFound) {
    console.warn('app does not exist');
  } else {
    throw err;
  }
}
```

The four canonical error sentinels (`ErrNotFound`, `ErrUnauthorized`,
`ErrRateLimited`, `ErrCapacity`) all extend `FaasError` and carry the
parsed RFC 7807 `Problem` envelope, the HTTP status, and the daemon's
`tx_id` for support tickets.

## Supported surface

Every operation in `api/openapi.yaml` is reachable through the
generated services. The canonical mapping:

| OpenAPI tag | Generated service |
|---|---|
| `account` | `AccountService` |
| `apps` | `AppsService` |
| `audit` | `AuditService` |
| `auth` | `AuthService` |
| `crons` | `CronsService` |
| `delayed_tasks` | `DelayedTasksService` |
| `deployments` | `DeploymentsService` |
| `domains` | `DomainsService` |
| `github` | `GithubService` |
| `instances` | `InstancesService` |
| `invocations` | `InvocationsService` |
| `keys` | `KeysService` |
| `meta` | `MetaService` |
| `mfa` | `MfaService` |
| `queues` | `QueuesService` |
| `secrets` | `SecretsService` |
| `usage` | `UsageService` |

Regenerate via `npm run gen` (committed per ADR-013; CI's
`sdk-gen-node` job is the dirty-diff gate).

## Idempotency contract

Every mutating call (POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE) carries an `Idempotency-Key`
header. The semantic contract is identical to the Go SDK:

- **Auto-mint (default).** The wrapper mints a fresh UUIDv4 on **every
  attempt**, not per-call. This means each retry sees a fresh key and
  the server's 24h replay window sees a fresh retry budget per attempt;
  a retried `CreateApp` is a new logical request from the server's
  perspective, never a double-bill.
- **Opt-in stable key.** For deployments that need to survive across
  processes (CI deploys, retry-batched jobs), pin a stable key so the
  server replays the original response on retry rather than minting
  new logic:

  ```ts
  client.setIdempotencyKey('deploy-2026-07-26-batch-7');
  await AppsService.createApp({ requestBody: { slug: 'foo' } });
  // Subsequent retries of the same logical operation will receive
  // the same response from the server's 24h replay window.
  ```

  The key is process-wide on the `FaaSClient` instance and persists
  until reset. Pass a fresh key per logically independent call.

GET/HEAD skip the header — the server doesn't dedupe reads.

The `client.setIdempotencyKey` API is the only public stable-key wire-in
in PR 5. A future AsyncLocalStorage-based per-call key (PR 11 if
docs customers request it) would layer on top without breaking the
existing contract.

## SSE streaming

The OpenAPI spec has no SSE endpoints today, but `/v1/logs/{app_id}/tail`
(and a few other out-of-spec streams) expose `text/event-stream`. Use
`streamSse`:

```ts
import { streamSse } from '@gregale/sdk-node';

const resp = await fetch(`${client.baseURL}/v1/logs/hello/tail`, {
  headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.FAAS_TOKEN}` },
});
for await (const ev of streamSse(resp, signal)) {
  console.log(ev.event, ev.data);
}
```

The parser handles the canonical SSE wire shape (LF or CRLF, comment
lines starting with `:`, multi-line `data:` joined with `\n`, unknown
fields ignored, `id:` + `retry:` surfaced). See
[`test/sse.test.ts`](./test/sse.test.ts) for the parsing contract.

`streamSse` honours the caller's `AbortSignal` for read cancellation
but does **not** layer a timeout — the caller owns the deadline. Pass
`AbortSignal.timeout(ms)` if you need a hard cap.

## Co-tenant code: the global fetch wrapper

The `FaaSClient` constructor replaces `globalThis.fetch` with the
wrapper chain (retry → RFC 7807 unwrap → logger → idempotency →
user fetch). This is the only injection point the
`openapi-typescript-codegen@0.31.0` generator exposes — see
`src/generated/core/request.ts:219`. **All other `fetch` calls in your
process see the wrapper too.**

Implications for callers:

- The wrapper is installed for the entire Node process, not just for
  requests routed through the SDK services. `fetch('https://other.example/')`
  in your code will also pass through the retry + idempotency stack.
- The `rfc7807Layer` raises typed `FaasError` sentinels on
  Problem-shaped bodies. If your own code calls `fetch` and inspects
  4xx/5xx responses, a 404 from your own endpoint will now throw
  `ErrNotFound` instead of returning a `Response` object. Two ways
  to mitigate:
  1. Pass a dedicated `fetch` via `FaaSClientOptions.fetch` — this
     bypasses the global entirely.
  2. Construct the `FaaSClient` only when you actually need it (e.g.
     inside a request handler), and call `uninstall()` on teardown.
- Two `FaaSClient` instances in the same process will clobber each
  other's wrapper. The library is designed for one `FaaSClient` per
  process (typical usage: module-level singleton).

Test rigs that mock `fetch` should pass `fetch: mockFn` via
`FaaSClientOptions` rather than setting `globalThis.fetch` directly —
the wrapper will chain the mock in the correct order.

## Zero runtime dependencies

`dependencies: {}` — the wrapper uses only Web APIs (`fetch`,
`AbortController`, `Headers`, `URL`) plus Node 22 built-ins
(`node:crypto`, `node:test`, `node:child_process`, `node:net`).

The `devDependencies` pin `openapi-typescript-codegen@0.31.0` and
`typescript@5.6.3`. Major-version bumps require an ADR.

## CI

The `sdk-gen-node` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs
`npm ci && npm run gen:check` (regen + dirty-diff assert). The
`sdk-smoke-node` job builds the fakeapid fixture, runs `npm run
test:smoke`, and tears down. The `sdk-unit-node` job runs the
in-process unit tests (`sse.test.ts`, `post-process.test.mjs`) which
don't require the fixture.
