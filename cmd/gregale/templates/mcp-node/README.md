# MCP on Gregale

This starter has three harmless tools, stateless Streamable HTTP, request-scoped
SSE progress, cancellation and optional external OAuth JWT authentication. It
supports MCP 2026-07-28 and stateless compatibility with 2025-11-25.

```
npm ci
npm test
npm start
gregale mcp doctor --url http://127.0.0.1:8080/mcp --legacy
gregale mcp call --url http://127.0.0.1:8080/mcp --tool add --arguments '{"a":7,"b":5}'
gregale mcp deploy --path . --name my-mcp --profile small
gregale mcp config --url https://my-mcp.gregale.dev/mcp --name my-mcp
```

`gregale-mcp.json` declares the MCP contract. `gregale.yaml` declares ordinary
HTTP hosting. The deploy command uploads the worktree, requires a streaming-enabled
plan, opens the platform public auth gate and verifies tool discovery. An empty
`allowed_origins` rejects every browser origin; non-browser MCP clients normally
omit Origin. Add exact trusted origins when a browser client needs access.

The starter explicitly uses public access. Before adding sensitive tools, set:

```json
"auth": {
  "mode": "external-oauth",
  "issuer": "https://identity.example.com",
  "jwks_url": "https://identity.example.com/.well-known/jwks.json",
  "resource": "https://my-mcp.gregale.dev/mcp",
  "scopes": ["mcp:tools"]
}
```

Configure the provider for OAuth 2.1, PKCE, authorization-server discovery and the
canonical MCP resource audience. The resource server verifies RS256/ES256 JWT
access tokens with an expiry and subject, issuer, audience and all required
scopes. Opaque tokens need a provider-specific introspection adapter. The provider
owns registration, login and consent; this starter does not implement those flows.
Scopes cover the endpoint; add tool-specific policy before serving different tool
permissions to different clients. Use a client token via `--token-env MCP_TOKEN`;
Gregale CLI account credentials are never forwarded to this server.

Keep durable state outside the VM. Avoid fetching customer credentials before
checkpointing; fetch short-lived credentials during a verified tool request.
Tool logs contain only name, duration and outcome. Calls are not automatically
retried. Doctor lists tools without executing them. An explicit `--stream-tool
stream_demo` doctor probe runs that tool and verifies spaced progress events.
