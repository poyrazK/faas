# Scaling policy

Scaling is configured per app. Keep at least one instance for latency-sensitive services, or allow zero to park idle workloads.

```bash
gregale app APP_ID scale --min 1 --max-concurrency 5
gregale app APP_ID scale --min 0 --max-concurrency 20
gregale app APP_ID
```

The platform uses request concurrency and resource pressure to choose a replica count in the configured range. A zero-min app parks after the plan's idle timeout and cold-wakes on the next request; see [Cold wake](cold-wake.md) for client expectations.

The API validates min/max values against the selected plan and rejects impossible combinations before changing the app. Set a realistic maximum to protect downstream services, and make handlers idempotent because retries can overlap during a scale event.
