# Event-driven workloads

Use asynchronous invokes, jobs, webhooks, and scheduled triggers when work does not need to finish in the request path.

```bash
gregale invoke --async --payload @payload.json APP_ID
gregale invoke --async --on-success-webhook WEBHOOK_ID --on-failure-webhook DLQ_WEBHOOK_ID APP_ID
gregale jobs run nightly --tasks 10
gregale crons add --app APP_ID --schedule "0 * * * *" --path /jobs/nightly
```

Handlers receive an event id and delivery attempt. Persist that id before applying side effects so retries are idempotent. Set explicit payload limits, timeouts, retry counts, and retention; route poison messages to a dead-letter destination for inspection and replay.

Keep synchronous endpoints small and return an acknowledgement only after the event is durably accepted. Verify webhook signatures and record the source, schema version, and correlation id in application logs.

Async invocations may name existing app webhook subscriptions as terminal
destinations. The success destination receives a durable `job.finished` event
after completion; the failure destination receives the same envelope when the
invocation permanently fails or exhausts its retry budget. Webhook delivery
has its own retry and dead-letter lifecycle, so a downstream outage does not
change the invocation result.

## Application inbox

For straightforward application-to-application work, send directly to the
target app without operating RabbitMQ, SQS, or NATS:

```bash
gregale send billing --type invoice.created \
  --data '{"invoice_id":"inv_123"}'
```

The equivalent API is `POST /v1/apps/billing/inbox`; the Go, Node, and Python
SDKs expose `SendAppMessage` / `sendAppMessage` / `send_app_message`.
Gregale normalizes the request into a CloudEvents 1.0 envelope and places that
envelope on the target's durable invocation queue. The normal queue depth,
wake, retry, trace, dead-letter, and replay behavior applies. Use `--id` for a
stable logical event id and `--idempotency-key` (or the API's
`Idempotency-Key` header) when retrying an uncertain request.

Delivery is at least once. The receiver must deduplicate the envelope's `id`
before applying non-idempotent side effects. This is an application inbox for
ordinary API-to-worker or service-to-service work, not a partitioned streaming
log or a Kafka replacement.

## Application outbox

Register the customer endpoint once so Gregale can validate the URL and seal
its signing secret, then deliver arbitrary application events through it:

```bash
gregale webhooks add --app checkout-api \
  --target-url https://customer.example/webhook \
  --secret "$WEBHOOK_SECRET"

gregale deliver checkout-api https://customer.example/webhook \
  --type order.paid --data '{"order_id":"ord_123"}'
```

The destination may also be the registered webhook id. The equivalent API is
`POST /v1/apps/checkout-api/outbox`; the first-party SDKs expose matching
delivery methods. Explicit delivery uses the registered destination's HMAC
secret, delivery format, timeout, and retry policy. It appears in the existing
delivery history and unified DLQ, where dead deliveries can be inspected and
replayed. The subscription's platform-event filter does not block an explicit
delivery to that destination.

Gregale signs the same canonical string and emits the same delivery headers as
ordinary app webhooks. Receivers should verify the signature, reject stale
timestamps, and deduplicate the durable delivery id.
Use `--idempotency-key` when retrying a `gregale deliver` call whose outcome
is unknown; a new key can enqueue a second delivery.

## Delayed tasks

Delayed tasks are durable one-shot invocations. The producer asks Gregale to
invoke an app at a future time, so it does not need to operate Redis, SQS,
EventBridge, or cron infrastructure.

Use either an absolute timestamp or a relative delay:

```bash
gregale delayed-task add --app billing --delay 30m \
  --path /internal/send-reminder --payload '{"invoice_id":"inv_123"}' \
  --header 'X-Correlation-ID:inv_123' \
  --max-attempts 4 --retry-base-seconds 1 --retry-max-seconds 30 \
  --retry-jitter-seconds 0.2 --retention 24h \
  --on-failure-webhook FAILURE_WEBHOOK_ID \
  --idempotency-key reminder-inv-123

gregale delayed-task add --app billing \
  --scheduled-at 2026-10-01T09:00:00Z --method POST --path /month-close
```

The API accepts the same target envelope as an asynchronous invocation:
`method`, `path`, `headers`, `payload`, `retry_policy`, `retention_seconds`,
and optional success/failure webhook destinations. Exactly one of
`scheduled_at` or `delay_seconds` is required. The time must be in the future
and no more than 365 days away.

The CLI exposes that complete envelope through repeatable `--header` flags,
the `--max-attempts` and `--retry-*` retry controls, `--retention`, and
`--on-success-webhook` / `--on-failure-webhook`. Retry settings must satisfy
the plan limits; omit them to use the plan defaults.

List, inspect, or cancel work without querying the general invocation ledger:

```bash
gregale delayed-task list --app billing
gregale delayed-task get TASK_ID
gregale delayed-task cancel TASK_ID
```

Cancellation prevents execution only while a task is still `pending`. A task
already `dispatching` may complete. Dispatch is at least once: retries after a
worker or network failure can invoke the target more than once, so application
side effects must be idempotent. Use a stable `Idempotency-Key` (or the CLI's
`--idempotency-key`) when retrying creation after an uncertain response; that
prevents duplicate task rows during the API's 24-hour replay window.

Paid plans support delayed tasks. The per-app pending limits are Hobby 5, Pro
50, and Scale 1,000,000. A purpose-built API key can use
`delayed_tasks:write` to create/cancel and `delayed_tasks:read` to list/get;
existing `deploy:write` and `apps:read` keys remain compatible.

## Internal event subscriptions

Applications can subscribe to events published through Gregale's internal
event router. A YAML deployment declares subscriptions with `event_triggers`:

For a first worker, scaffold the complete example instead of writing the
manifest and handler by hand:

```bash
gregale init --template event-worker --path ./invoice-worker
cd invoice-worker && gregale deploy --name invoice-worker
```

The generated project includes a safe `billing.*` / `invoice.paid` filter and
an acknowledgement handler. Edit `gregale.yaml` when your event vocabulary is
ready.

```yaml
event_triggers:
  - source: billing.*
    type: invoice.paid
    filter: '{"data":{"amount":{"$gt":100}}}'
```

The filter is a JSON object encoded as a string. `app` is optional for a
single-app deploy and is bound to the target application during source-ref
reconciliation. Event-only projects may use the equivalent TOML form,
`[[triggers.event]]`. Both forms use the same source/type/filter validation;
matching deliveries inherit the router's retry and dead-letter behavior.
When a delivery reaches a terminal failure, inspect and replay it through the
app's unified dead-letter queue (`gregale dlq <app>`); its origin is shown as
`event_subscription`.

Publish an event from the CLI without learning the CloudEvents envelope. Gregale
generates the stable event id for you:

```bash
gregale events publish billing.stripe invoice.paid \
  --data '{"amount":150}'
```

Use `--id` when a producer is retrying the same logical event and needs to
choose the idempotency key explicitly. The flag-based form remains supported:

```bash
gregale events publish --id evt-123 --source billing.stripe --type invoice.paid \
  --data '{"amount":150}'
```

To confirm what Gregale reconciled for an app, list its active manifest
subscriptions directly:

```bash
gregale events subscriptions APP
gregale events subscriptions APP --json
gregale events deliveries APP
gregale events deliveries APP --state failed --json
```

This is useful after a deploy or manifest change: it shows the normalized
source, type, filter, and enabled state that the router will use.

After publishing, use `events deliveries` to see the matching event id,
delivery state, attempt count, and last lifecycle timestamp without searching
the account-wide invocation ledger. `--event-id` narrows the view to one
published event; `--state` can focus on pending, failed, or dead-lettered
deliveries.

The machine-readable event contract is published in
[`api/asyncapi.yaml`](../api/asyncapi.yaml), including the authenticated
`POST /v1/events:publish` ingress.
