# Managed realtime operations

`faas-realtimed.service` owns opt-in managed WebSocket connections. It listens
on `/run/faas/realtimed.sock`; `gatewayd-internal` forwards the reserved
`/__gregale/realtime/` namespace there when
`FAAS_REALTIME_SOCKET=/run/faas/realtimed.sock` is set.

The service is intentionally separate from the raw application WebSocket
bridge. Restarting it closes managed connections and emits disconnect events;
application-owned raw Upgrade sessions are unaffected.

Register an endpoint (normally from an authorized control-plane process), then
connect clients to `wss://<app-host>/__gregale/realtime/<endpoint-id>`:

Customer applications should use the authenticated API resource instead of
writing the daemon socket directly:

```
POST /v1/apps/{slug}/realtime/endpoints
GET|PATCH|DELETE /v1/apps/{slug}/realtime/endpoints/{id}
```

The API persists endpoint configuration in the control plane, applies the
per-plan inventory cap, returns masked credentials, and best-effort mirrors the
row to a local realtimed owner when `FAAS_REALTIME_SOCKET` is configured. The
daemon-socket example below remains useful for node-local bootstrap and
recovery tooling.

```
curl --unix-socket /run/faas/realtimed.sock -X POST http://localhost/internal/endpoints \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"id":"notifications","app_id":"app-123","account_id":"acct-123","callback_url":"https://notifications.example.com","connect_path":"/_gregale/realtime/connect","message_path":"/_gregale/realtime/message","disconnect_path":"/_gregale/realtime/disconnect","callback_auth_token":"optional-callback-bearer"}'
```

The callback URL should be an ordinary application route. Its first request
wakes a sleeping VM; the quiet WebSocket itself remains owned by `realtimed`.
Use `pkg/realtime.Client` (or the equivalent management HTTP calls) to send to
a `connection_id`, subscribe/publish channels, or close a connection.
The current registry is node-local, so endpoint registration and management
must target the realtimed node that owns the connections.

Inspect health and counters from the `faas` group:

```
curl --unix-socket /run/faas/realtimed.sock http://localhost/healthz
curl --unix-socket /run/faas/realtimed.sock http://localhost/internal/stats
curl --unix-socket /run/faas/realtimed.sock http://localhost/internal/connections
```

Set `FAAS_REALTIME_MAX_CONNECTIONS`,
`FAAS_REALTIME_MAX_MESSAGE_BYTES`, `FAAS_REALTIME_OUTBOUND_QUEUE`,
`FAAS_REALTIME_HEARTBEAT`, `FAAS_REALTIME_PONG_WAIT`,
`FAAS_REALTIME_WRITE_WAIT`, `FAAS_REALTIME_MAX_AGE`, and
`FAAS_REALTIME_CALLBACK_TIMEOUT` in the realtimed environment file when
adjusting limits. Keep the callback URL on an ordinary app route so the normal
gateway wake path can start a sleeping application to process an event.
