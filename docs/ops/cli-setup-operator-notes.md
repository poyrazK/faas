# CLI guide: maintainer notes

Moved out of the customer page `docs/cli-setup.md` (ADR-20261028200304).

## Why no checked-in `contrib/completion/`?

The binary is the source of truth. Every `cliCommand{}` entry in
`cli_meta.go` shows up in all four shell backends at compile time,
and the manifest-drift test fires when a new command ships
without a matching entry. A checked-in copy would drift the
moment the manifest changes — the operator would either re-run
the install script (defeating the point of checking it in) or
ship a stale completion script.

## Why no checked-in `docs/man/`?

Same reasoning: the man pages are rendered from the manifest at
process boot, so they always reflect the current binary. A checked-
in copy would drift the same way.
