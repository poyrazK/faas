# gregale CLI — shell completion + man pages setup

The gregale CLI emits shell completion scripts and man pages from the
binary itself. No checked-in copies in `contrib/completion/`; the
binary is the source of truth. This doc covers the install path for
each shell, plus the man-page install for offline / CI use.

## Selecting an app

`gregale logs`, `gregale logs tail`, `gregale inspect`, and `gregale open`
use an explicit app slug first, then the app saved by `gregale link`.
When neither identifies an app, an interactive terminal offers an app picker.
Type search text to filter by app slug, project, or status, then enter a
displayed number or exact slug. `/` clears the filter; `q` or Ctrl-C cancels.
An empty answer does not select an app.

The picker stays within the linked project when one exists. It shows project
membership and status, and labels any saved environment as the linked
environment. These app commands do not select an environment deployment.
Selection applies only to this invocation and does not change the saved link.

JSON output, `--non-interactive`, and redirected input or output never prompt.
For scripts, pass the slug explicitly or save a specific app with
`gregale link <project-slug> --app <slug>`. `gregale open` also accepts
`--app <slug>`.

## Quick reference

| Shell | Command | Install path (user) | Install path (system) |
|---|---|---|---|
| bash | `gregale completion bash` | `~/.local/share/bash-completion/completions/gregale` | `/usr/share/bash-completion/completions/gregale` |
| zsh | `gregale completion zsh` | `${fpath[1]}/_gregale` (usually `~/.zsh/completions/_gregale`) | `/usr/share/zsh/site-functions/_gregale` |
| fish | `gregale completion fish` | `~/.config/fish/completions/gregale.fish` | `/usr/share/fish/vendor_completions.d/gregale.fish` |
| powershell | `gregale completion powershell` | profile-script snippet (see below) | n/a |

## bash

```bash
# System-wide (requires sudo, persists for all users):
sudo gregale completion bash > /usr/share/bash-completion/completions/gregale

# User-local (no sudo, survives OS upgrades):
gregale completion bash > ~/.local/share/bash-completion/completions/gregale

# One-shot, current shell only (great for testing):
source <(gregale completion bash)
```

macOS users: bash 3.2 ships as `/bin/bash`. The completion script is
compatible — no `mapfile`, no associative arrays. For bash 4+ (via
Homebrew `bash`), the script still works; bash 5+ even offers the
slightly faster `compopt -o nospace` we could turn on in a future
PR.

## zsh

```bash
# System-wide (persists for all users):
sudo gregale completion zsh > /usr/share/zsh/site-functions/_gregale

# User-local:
gregale completion zsh > ~/.zsh/completions/_gregale
# then add this to ~/.zshrc (only if not already on fpath):
#   fpath=(~/.zsh/completions $fpath)
#   autoload -U compinit && compinit
```

The script emits `#compdef gregale` as the first line; zsh's
autoload machinery picks it up automatically when the file lands on
$fpath. After install, restart the shell or run `rehash` +
`autoload -U compinit && compinit`.

## fish

```bash
# User-local (no sudo):
gregale completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/gregale.fish

# System-wide:
sudo gregale completion fish > /usr/share/fish/vendor_completions.d/gregale.fish
```

Fish picks up completion scripts automatically; no `rehash` needed.
Reload the current shell with `exec fish` to see new completions
immediately.

## powershell

Add this snippet to your PowerShell profile (`$PROFILE`):

```powershell
gregale completion powershell | Out-String | Invoke-Expression
```

The snippet registers an argument completer via
`Register-ArgumentCompleter -Native -CommandName 'gregale'`. Re-run
the snippet after upgrading gregale if completion starts misbehaving.

## man pages

```bash
# Render the top-level gregale(1):
gregale man | man -l -

# Render a per-command page (e.g. gregale-alerts(1)):
gregale man alerts | man -l -

# Install permanently (system-wide):
sudo install -m 0644 <(gregale man) /usr/local/share/man/man1/gregale.1
sudo install -m 0644 <(gregale man alerts) /usr/local/share/man/man1/gregale-alerts.1
sudo mandb   # refresh the man-db index
man gregale-alerts
```

The per-command man page slug is `gregale-<command>` (e.g.
`gregale-alerts`, `gregale-delayed-task`). When `gregale man
<command>` is run with a non-existent command, exit 1 surfaces the
unknown-command error path explicitly.

## Slug cache (how completion knows your app names)

The per-account positional completion paths (e.g. `<slug>` in
`gregale app <slug> ...`) read from a JSON file at
`~/.config/gregale/completion-cache.json`. The file is rewritten
on every successful `gregale apps` / `gregale orgs` call (the
`pkg/api/client.go::doReq` middleware does the rewrite; no user
action needed).

The file is keyed by:

- `apps`: list of `{id, slug, name}` records from `GET /v1/apps`.
- `orgs`: list of `{id, slug, name}` records from `GET /v1/orgs`.
- `saved_at`: RFC3339 timestamp.

To force a refresh, `rm` the file:

```bash
rm ~/.config/gregale/completion-cache.json
gregale apps      # repopulates the cache
```

The cache file is mode 0600 and the dir is mode 0700 — equivalent
visibility to a token-respecting `gregale apps` call. There's no
need to seal it like env secrets; the contents are public to the
account owner.

## Why no checked-in `contrib/completion/`?

The binary is the source of truth. Every `cliCommand{}` entry in
`cli_meta.go` shows up in all four shell backends at compile time,
and the manifest-drift test fires when a new command ships
without a matching entry. A checked-in copy would drift the
moment the manifest changes — the operator would either re-run
the install script (defeating the point of checking it in) or
ship a stale completion script.

## Why no checked-in `docs/man/`?

Same reasoning: the man pages are rendered from the manifest at
process boot, so they always reflect the current binary. A checked-
in copy would drift the same way.
