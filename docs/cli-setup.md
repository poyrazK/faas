# gregale CLI — shell completion + man pages setup

The gregale CLI emits shell completion scripts and man pages from the
binary itself. No checked-in copies in `contrib/completion/`; the
binary is the source of truth. This doc covers the install path for
each shell, plus the man-page install for offline / CI use.

## Find a command by task

Search local command descriptions, examples, flags, and task keywords when you
know what you want to do but do not know the command name:

```sh
gregale help --search "restart after changing secrets"
gregale help --search "compare environments"
gregale help --search "reduce costs"
gregale help --search "costs" --json
```

Search runs offline without login and shows up to eight ranked results with
usage, available examples, and documentation links. Quote multi-word queries.
Use `--all` with `--search` to include operator and compatibility commands.
No matches is a successful search with an empty `results` array in JSON output;
invalid or empty queries exit with code 1. Search displays commands and does
not execute them.

## Quick reference

| Shell | Command | Install path (user) | Install path (system) |
|---|---|---|---|
| bash | `gregale completion bash` | `~/.local/share/bash-completion/completions/gregale` | `/usr/share/bash-completion/completions/gregale` |
| zsh | `gregale completion zsh` | `${fpath[1]}/_gregale` (usually `~/.zsh/completions/_gregale`) | `/usr/share/zsh/site-functions/_gregale` |
| fish | `gregale completion fish` | `~/.config/fish/completions/gregale.fish` | `/usr/share/fish/vendor_completions.d/gregale.fish` |
| powershell | `gregale completion powershell` | profile-script snippet (see below) | n/a |

## bash

```bash
# System-wide (requires sudo, persists for all users):
sudo gregale completion bash > /usr/share/bash-completion/completions/gregale

# User-local (no sudo, survives OS upgrades):
gregale completion bash > ~/.local/share/bash-completion/completions/gregale

# One-shot, current shell only (great for testing):
source <(gregale completion bash)
```

macOS users: bash 3.2 ships as `/bin/bash`. The completion script is
compatible — no `mapfile`, no associative arrays. For bash 4+ (via
Homebrew `bash`), the script still works; bash 5+ even offers the
slightly faster `compopt -o nospace` we could turn on in a future
PR.

## zsh

```bash
# System-wide (persists for all users):
sudo gregale completion zsh > /usr/share/zsh/site-functions/_gregale

# User-local:
gregale completion zsh > ~/.zsh/completions/_gregale
# then add this to ~/.zshrc (only if not already on fpath):
#   fpath=(~/.zsh/completions $fpath)
#   autoload -U compinit && compinit
```

The script emits `#compdef gregale` as the first line; zsh's
autoload machinery picks it up automatically when the file lands on
$fpath. After install, restart the shell or run `rehash` +
`autoload -U compinit && compinit`.

## fish

```bash
# User-local (no sudo):
gregale completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/gregale.fish

# System-wide:
sudo gregale completion fish > /usr/share/fish/vendor_completions.d/gregale.fish
```

Fish picks up completion scripts automatically; no `rehash` needed.
Reload the current shell with `exec fish` to see new completions
immediately.

## powershell

Add this snippet to your PowerShell profile (`$PROFILE`):

```powershell
gregale completion powershell | Out-String | Invoke-Expression
```

The snippet registers an argument completer via
`Register-ArgumentCompleter -Native -CommandName 'gregale'`. Re-run
the snippet after upgrading gregale if completion starts misbehaving.

## man pages

```bash
# Render the top-level gregale(1):
gregale man | man -l -

# Render a per-command page (e.g. gregale-alerts(1)):
gregale man alerts | man -l -

# Install permanently (system-wide):
sudo install -m 0644 <(gregale man) /usr/local/share/man/man1/gregale.1
sudo install -m 0644 <(gregale man alerts) /usr/local/share/man/man1/gregale-alerts.1
sudo mandb   # refresh the man-db index
man gregale-alerts
```

The per-command man page slug is `gregale-<command>` (e.g.
`gregale-alerts`, `gregale-delayed-task`). When `gregale man
<command>` is run with a non-existent command, exit 1 surfaces the
unknown-command error path explicitly.

## Slug cache (how completion knows your app names)

The per-account positional completion paths (e.g. `<slug>` in
`gregale app <slug> ...`) read from a JSON file at
`~/.config/gregale/completion-cache.json`. The file is rewritten
on every successful `gregale apps` / `gregale orgs` call (the
`pkg/api/client.go::doReq` middleware does the rewrite; no user
action needed).

The file is keyed by:

- `apps`: list of `{id, slug, name}` records from `GET /v1/apps`.
- `orgs`: list of `{id, slug, name}` records from `GET /v1/orgs`.
- `saved_at`: RFC3339 timestamp.

To force a refresh, `rm` the file:

```bash
rm ~/.config/gregale/completion-cache.json
gregale apps      # repopulates the cache
```

The cache file is mode 0600 and the dir is mode 0700 — equivalent
visibility to a token-respecting `gregale apps` call. There's no
need to seal it like env secrets; the contents are public to the
account owner.

## Why no checked-in `contrib/completion/`?

The binary is the source of truth. Every `cliCommand{}` entry in
`cli_meta.go` shows up in all four shell backends at compile time,
and the manifest-drift test fires when a new command ships
without a matching entry. A checked-in copy would drift the
moment the manifest changes — the operator would either re-run
the install script (defeating the point of checking it in) or
ship a stale completion script.

## Why no checked-in `docs/man/`?

Same reasoning: the man pages are rendered from the manifest at
process boot, so they always reflect the current binary. A checked-
in copy would drift the same way.
